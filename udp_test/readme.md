These codes are used to test data transmission in UDP.

Client will transport from 1 to 10000 and loop repeat to Server.

Note that output of Server will not always print successful transmission information.

But when packet lost, Server will print the informations of lost packets.

Like packets number, lost rate, and average transmission time.
