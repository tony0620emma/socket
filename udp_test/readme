The C codes can transport data in UDP from client to server.

First, compile C codes with makefile.

Makefile has two parts, one is "main" for compile server and client.

Another is "clean" for delete execution file.

Execute $make main to compile in terminal, then you can test these codes.

You have to execute server first and then client in two different terminal.

Before execution, make sure you had put data file that will be transported in codes file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After execute server and client in two terminal.

You can see client finished when all data already transport.

If server finished too, that means all packets transport successfully.

Else if server wasn't finished, that means there were some packets lost.

Then you can see transport success rate in server terminal.
